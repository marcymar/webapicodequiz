what i need to do for this assignment: 
overall project is making a timed quiz
it needs to:
    - when clicking the start button a timer begins
    and a question pops up
    - answer question and another pops up 
    - if answered wrong then there is a time penalty and seconds are taken off the clock
    - after all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero the quiz/game is over
    - there should be an input area for the player to put their initials
    - a return to main menu button and a clear high score board.
